Object Oriented Programming in JavaScript:

    There is a constructor function that can be used to construct objects.(from our programming in JavaScript) - Prototypal inheritance: legacy ways of doing object oriented programming in JavaScript.

    Advanced/ES5 ES6(Real Object Oriented way): Instead of using constructor function, we use something that is called a "class" and then we create object of that class.

    Syntax:

    class Student{

       //member variables
        firstName;
        lastName;

        //member functions/methods

        printName(){
            console.log(this.firstName);

        }

        setName(f,l){
            this.firstName = f;
            this.lastName = l;
                   }
        getLastName(){
            return this.lastName;
        }
    }



    class defines a blueprint that contains data and functions inside it.


    To use this class, we NEED to create "object". [class itself is not usable, unless we create object of it that contains all the features of the class inside it - PROVE IT SOME OTHER WAY]


    In JavaScript classes, the constructor function is literally called "constructor"

    In ALL other Object Oriented Programming languages, constructor function has the same name as "class"..

    constructor function in class is automatically/implicitly called when the object of this class is created.
    
    Other than constructor all functions need to be explicitly called. 

    In every class, we have setter and getter functiosn
    
    setters to set something for the class
    getters to get something fromn the class

    Every class can have a special fucntion called "constructor". The constructor function actually is called "implicitly" when the object is created.

undefined * undefined = NaN
x * undefined = NaN


static methods and fields:

Keyword "static" makes the member function or variable as "class level component" NOT "object level component".

Now I can access the static member by using the class name ... 
Math.random(); //Math is a class and it has static random() function inside it..
Math.sqrt();

localStorage: 
API that enables us to use "browser's memory" to remember few objects during the life of the web page...

localStorage stores data in JSON format...
    {"title":"java","author","Ivro HOrton","isbn",1223} a json object that we cannot direclty read rather we need convert it into normal object...

    
    {title:"java",author:"Ivor Horton", isbn:1233} normal object that i can read...

    JSON format is very widely used data type to store/send data over different apis...JSON(Java Script Object Notation)
