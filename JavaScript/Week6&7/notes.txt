AJAX & Asynchronous programming in JavaScript:

AJAX: Asynchronous JavaScript And XML(eXtensible Markup Language)

Asynchronous programming enables us to run a specific code after some other execution in case we need to wait for something...

1. Callback functions:
2. Promises in JavaScript:
3. Async/Await


Make async requests in the background.. so that no page reload /refesh is done...Very interactive...


a) XMLHttpRequest(XHR) Object:
    XHR enables us to access something in background without disturbing the UI, or without reloading/refreshing the page...
    JSON: JavaScript Object Notation..Most of the APIs use JSON format to send data... its a standard method to transfer data over internet...XML was a mthod that was used before..
    
    normalObject = {name:"Alan Smith",email:"alan@gmail.com"}
    jsonObject = {"name":"Alan Smith","email":"alan@gmail.com"} 
    
    WE CANNOT READ THE 
    PROPERTIES OF JSON OBJECT DIRECTLY, RATHER WE NEED TO CONVERT IT INTO NORMAL OBJECT TO READ IT.

    The APIs that provide data to play with!
    Most of APIs are of some cost... and others are FREE..

    GET: Retrieve data
    POST: Post submit data
    PUT: update data
    DELETE: delete data..

    users.json... POST ... a new use should be added...
    PUT..... christina phone to something...
    DELETE.... 1 ... delete that person

    ENDPOINTS:

    GET https://someurl.com/api/users...
    GET https://someurl.com/api/users/1..

b) Fetch API: Fetch API actually returns promises!

    Promises in JavaScript!
    Condition to attend tomorrow class!

    Read and try to understand the concepts there till TASK2... (dont worry about Task3 - lateron...)

    Promises:
        resolve (fullfilled the promise)
        reject  (did not fullfill the promise)
